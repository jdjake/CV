%\section{Research Projects}

%\begin{entrylist}

%\entry
%{2021-Now}
%{Radial Fourier Multipliers on Manifolds}
%{}
%{\emph{Collaboration with Dr. Andreas Seeger}. The goal of this project is to use the technology of Fourier Integral Operators to extend results about radial Fourier multipliers on Euclidean space to obtain bounds for multipliers for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on compact Riemannian manifolds.}

%Our current progress is detailed in notes linked \href{https://github.com/jdjake/Notes/blob/master/Research/FourierIntegralOperators/RadialMultipliers.pdf}{here}.

%------------------------------------------------

%\entry
%{2020-Now}
%{Salem Sets Avoiding Patterns}
%{}
%{The goal of this project is to explore relations between the Fourier transform and methods of high dimensional probability. Using these methods, I constructed large Salem sets avoiding patterns.

%new tools which enable one to extend pattern avoidance methods which construct sets with large Hausdorff dimension avoiding patterns, to construct large Salem sets avoiding patterns. I am currently exploring ways to improve the probabilistic construction methods discussed in the paper ``Large Salem Sets Avoiding Nonlinear Configurations'' to construct optimal Salem sets avoiding patterns, as well as exploring the use of techniques based in extremizer theory to calculate the Fourier dimension of surfaces in Euclidean space with large codimension.}

%------------------------------------------------

%\entry
%{2018-2019}
%{Large Sets Avoiding Rough Patterns}
%{}
%{\emph{Collaboration with Dr. Malabika Pramanik and Dr. Joshua Zahl.} In this project, we found subsets of Euclidean space with large Hausdorff dimension avoiding point configurations.}%, which might be described as having a `rough' character, such as those related to additive structure on fractals.}

%------------------------------------------------

%\entry
%{2017}
%{Lagrangian Preserving Approximation for Vehicle Routing}
%{}
%{\emph{Collaboration with Dr. Zachary Friggstad}. This project involves using the Lagrangian preserving approximation technique combined with a novel linear relaxation of variants of the vehicle routing problem to obtain state of the art approximation algorithms. Our work is detailed in notes linked \href{https://github.com/jdjake/Notes/raw/master/Research/VehicleRouting/VehicleRouting.pdf}{here}.}

%-------------------------------------------------

%\entry
%{2015-2016}
%{Universal Store Record Linkage}
%{}
%{\emph{Collaboration with Dr. Aman Kansal and Ram Chandrasekaran}. As an intern, developed data linkage methods in Microsoft's Universal Store department in Redmond, Washington. My main responsibility was reading articles and white papers on the record linkage problem, and developing the ideas in those papers into usable software. My software removed redundant information from Microsoft's database, which took up 20\% of the size of the entire database.}

%-------------------------------------------------

%\entry
%{2014}
%{Cognate Identification}
%{}
%{\emph{Collaboration with Garret Nicolai and Dr. Greg Kondrak}. Developed cognate recognition algorithms with the NLP group at the University of Alberta. Created a centralized database for storing cognate information. This program was successfully used by linguists at the University of Alberta to understand the Totonac language group. Garrett Nicolai supervised the project (Nicolai@ualberta.ca).}
